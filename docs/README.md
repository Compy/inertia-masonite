# Introduction and installation

Documentation for [masonite-inertia](https://github.com/girardinsamuel/masonite-inertia) adapter for MasoniteFramework and [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/).

The existing documentation is really good but documents only official Laravel and Rails server side adapters. You will find mostly the same content but written for MasoniteFramework !

This documentation is a work in progress  ! Coming soon in January 2021 !
