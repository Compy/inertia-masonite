# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for [inertia-masonite](https://github.com/eaguad1337/masonite-inertia) adapter for [MasoniteFramework](https://docs.masoniteproject.com) and [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com).&#x20;

## Why an other documentation?

The existing documentation is really good but documents only official **Laravel** and **Rails** server side adapters. Here, you will find mostly the same content but written for [MasoniteFramework](https://docs.masoniteproject.com) !

This documentation is of course based on official [Inertia.js documentation](https://inertiajs.com), but will only explains how to use Inertia.js with MasoniteFramework and won't explain again how to configure and use it client-side as it's already covered in official documentation.

{% hint style="info" %}
Throughout the documentation, you will see that code examples are the same as the official server-side documentation in order to ease the understanding. If something is not clear please first go to official documentation to check if more details are given.
{% endhint %}

## Official Inertia adapters

I am tracking new features and improvements added to official laravel-inertia adapter. I am trying to port those features on this adapter as well when I can.

Most important features are available in this adapter. The latest ones might not be there but feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/girardinsamuel/masonite-inertia/issues/new) for it and [any help](development/contribute.md) is welcome !

## Disclaimer

This project was originally started by [Samuel Girardin](https://github.com/girardinsamuel), that was a core maintainer of Masonite Framework, along with Joe Mancuso (creator of the framework) and other great packages like Exceptionite, Masonite Debugbar and so on. Since Sam stopped contributing and left some packages behind, I decided to continue his work and continue maintaining this and other packages related to Masonite Ecosystem.
